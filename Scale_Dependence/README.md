The script `scale_dependence_files.py` reads the grid files located in the same directory and re-evaluates them for a set of different energy scale factors. It can be executed with:

```bash
python3 scale_dependence_files.py
```

The script `scale_dependence.py` scans the specified directory and reads the `.out` files generated by `scale_dependence_files.py`. It then plots the cross sections for different scale factors across the various observables and bins, displaying the LO, NLO, and NNLO contributions on the same plot. It also produces heatmap and 3D summary plots. It is run as follows:

```bash
python3 scale_dependence.py data_fixedmuf --out plots_fixedmuf
```
